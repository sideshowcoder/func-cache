# func-cache

A Clojure library using first class functions as a synchronisation mechanism
based on [go-cache](https://github.com/zpatrick/go-cache)

The storage is provided by a transient hash-map which is exposed over a channel,
meaning all operations a serialized and therefore don't require locking. Only
one thread is ever operating on the map even if the handle is passed to many.

## Usage

```clojure
(let [handle (func-cache)]
  (cache-empty? handle) ;; true
  (cache-insert handle :foo "bar")
  (cache-get handle :foo) ;; "bar"
  (cache-empty? handle) ;; false
  (cache-destroy handle)) ;; close the handle
```

## Why?

This is by no means ment to be used in any real application, as it will be
significantly slower than using the clojure builtin transactions. It was done to
explore a concept of using functions as messages, which can be a very powerful
idea.
